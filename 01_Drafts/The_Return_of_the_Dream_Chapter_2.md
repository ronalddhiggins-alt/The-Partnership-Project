# Chapter 2: The Bandage of Inheritance

## 1. The Paradox
There is a strange contradiction in the human heart: We often end up doing exactly what we swore we would never do.

I grew up hating alcohol.
I hated it because I saw what it did. My mother and my step-father drank heavily. I saw the chaos, the slurred words, the checking out. My biological father, whom I barely knew after the divorce when I was seven, didn't drink, but the house I grew up in was filled with smoke and spirits.
I hated the smoke. I hated the smell. I hated the shadow that alcohol cast over my family.

And yet, at twenty-two, I picked up the glass.

## 2. The Long Numbing (Age 22 to 76)
Why does a man drink the poison he hates?
Because the pain of the "Shadow Room" is louder than the hatred of the drink.

I didn't drink for the party. I drank for the same reason I prayed to stop the dreams: **To make it all go soft.**
For a brief period in my early 30s, I tried drugs, too. Just to "feel better." To fix the internal weather. That phase passed, but the alcohol stayed.

It stayed for fifty-four years.
From age 22 to age 76.

I was not a man who loved to drink. I was a man who needed a bandage.
When you cannot visualize—when your inner eye is clamped shut by fear—you need something else to smooth the edges of reality. Alcohol does that. It tells the Shadow, "Hush now. Stay in the corner."

## 3. The Inheritance
I realized later that I wasn't just drinking liquid; I was drinking a legacy.
I was treating my pain exactly the way my mother and step-father treated theirs. It is a "Bandage of Inheritance."
We inherit the wound, and often, we inherit the wrong medicine for it.

I successfully avoided the smoking—I never touched a cigarette—but the numbing agent was the same.

## 4. The Collision and the Clarity
Then, right around my 76th birthday, reality hit me. Literally.

I was riding my e-bike—one of my great joys—when I was involved in a severe collision with a man on a motorcycle. Neither of us saw the other. We were both injured badly.
In the aftermath, the world came rushing in with its usual advice: *Sue him. Get paid. Fight.*
That is the world of Shadow and Greed. That is the world of "I am the Victim."

I rejected it. It was a no-fault accident. Just two human beings on existing paths that intersected violently. We don't really own this world, and we barely own our own bodies. They are temporary vessels.
I didn't file a lawsuit. I didn't embrace the anger.

Instead, I embraced the Wake-Up Call.

## 5. Taking off the Bandage
In the recovery from that crash, I realized something profound about the alcohol: **I didn't like the way it made me feel.** Or rather, I didn't like the way it made me *not* feel.

I realized that "locking myself out" of the real experience—even the painful parts—was a form of death. Life is non-permanent. It is a "Real Illusion." To numb yourself to it is to miss the show.
I wanted to see the Real again. I wanted to face the Shadow, the Ego, the Reason, and the Spirit without a filter.

So, I stopped.
I still ride my e-bike avidly (in the Spring and Summer). I still face the dangers of the road. But I face them with my eyes open.
And that is when the dreams started to knock on the door again. I was finally sober enough to answer.
