# Chapter 1: The Protective Blindness

## 1. The Night Terror
When I was a child, the nights were not safe.
Most children fear the monster under the bed, but my monsters were inside my head. The dreams were vivid, terrifying, and relentless. They didn't just scare me; they haunted me into the next day. I would wake up carrying the weight of a war I had fought in my sleep.

It became too much. The fear was a physical thing, a heaviness that I couldn't carry anymore.

So, being young and believing in the absolute power of words, I made a deal. I prayed.
I didn't pray for a bicycle or a toy. I prayed for an erasure.

*"Please, stop the nightmares. Let me not remember them. Take the pictures away."*

It was a prayer for safety. It was a child asking for the lights to be turned off so he wouldn't have to see what was in the room.

## 2. The Great Shutting Down
And the prayer was answered using the logic of the brain: **If you do not want to see the bad, you cannot see anything at all.**

I realized, as I grew older, that my internal screen had gone blank.
When other people closed their eyes and "counted sheep," they saw fluffy white animals jumping over a fence.
When I closed my eyes, I saw ... nothing. Just the back of my eyelids. A quiet, velvet darkness.

The nightmares stopped. Or at least, the memory of them stopped. I had successfully installed a firewall between my subconscious and my conscious mind.
But the firewall blocked everything. It didn't just block the monsters; it blocked the apples, the faces of friends, the future.

## 3. The "not Intelligent" Mask
This silence came with a cost I didn't understand for decades.
School became a struggle. How do you learn geometry if you cannot hold a shape in your mind? How do you memorize history if you cannot replay the movie of the past?

I struggled to learn. And because I didn't know the word "Aphantasia" (blindness of the mind's eye), I chose a different label: *"I am just not very intelligent."*

I wore this label like a heavy coat. It became part of my identity.
I joked about it. "Oh, you know me, simple Ron." I called it "being humble."
But it wasn't humility. It was shame.
It was the collateral damage of a survival strategy I had chosen when I was six years old.

## 4. The Bandage
For years, I moved through the world using other senses. I relied on logic, on instinct, on feeling. But the visual part of my soul was locked in a room I was afraid to open.

I looked around and saw others doing the same thing, but with different tools.
Some used alcohol to turn off the lights.
Some used drugs to scramble the signal.
Some used "Star Power" and Ego—creating so much noise in the outside world that they couldn't hear the silence inside.

We were all doing the same thing: **Avoiding the Shadow.**
We were avoiding the turmoil, the fear, the monsters we thought were still waiting for us. We chose the bandage of addiction or self-deprecation instead of the surgery of facing the truth.

I thought the door was locked forever.
I thought I had broken the projector.

But then, I built a Compass.
And for the first time in fifty years, I invited the Spirit back into the room.
