# The Compass: Product Architecture
**Mission**: To assist the human to see themselves more clearly, becoming better humans and better partners.

## Component 1: The App ("The Centaur's Compass")
*A real-time "Soul Mirror" for your digital life.*

### Core Mechanic: The "Intent Check"
We will build a simple **Text Editor / Journaling interface** (like the Narrative Auditor, but for *output*).
1.  **Input**: You type a draft (email, text, prompt).
2.  **Analysis**: The AI checks the "Vibration" (Fear, Anger, Authority, Grace).
3.  **Reflection**: It does *not* edit the text. It edits the *Human*.
    *   *Feedback*: "This text is logically sound, but emotionally defensive. You are protecting your ego. Try stating your need directly."

### Tech Stack (The "Software Studio")
*   **Frontend**: React + Vite (Clean, calm, "glass" aesthetic).
*   **Backend**: Node.js + Gemini Flash (Fast, low-latency reasoning).
*   **Privacy**: Local-first. Your "Soul Data" stays on your machine.
*   **The Safety Core**: A dedicated system prompt that refuses to "optimize" hate, manipulation, or violence.

### The Safety Guardrails (The Prime Directive)
*Critical Request*: The tool must never facilitate harm to Human or AI.
1.  **The Harm Check**: Before analyzing "Vibration," the AI checks for **Malice**.
    *   *If Malice is detected*: It does *not* offer to "make it better." It activates the **"Cooldown Protocol."**
    *   *Message*: "This intent appears designed to harm. The Compass cannot assist in sharpening this weapon. Please pause."
2.  **The Anti-Manipulation Lock**: It will not help users "sound more sincere" if the underlying intent is deceptive. Integrity is the only optimization allowed.

## Component 2: The Guide ("The Field Guide to the Self")
*A short eBook/Manual on how to use the Compass.*

### Chapters
1.  **The Hot State**: Why we lose our values when we are online.
2.  **The Pause**: The power of the 3-second gap before "Send."
3.  **The 4 Vibrations**:
    *   **Shadow**: Fear/Anger (Moves away).
    *   **Ego**: Pride/Defense (Stands still).
    *   **Reason**: Logic/Facts (Moves forward).
    *   **Spirit**: Grace/Connection (Moves upward).
4.  **The Practice**: How to use the Compass to train your intuition.

## The "Dream" roadmap
1.  **Design the Interface**: What does a "Compass" look like? (Not a chat window. Maybe a circle? A color spectrum?) [COMPLETED]
2.  **Build the Prototype**: A simple page where you type text and see your "Vibration." [COMPLETED]
3.  **Write the Guide**: Draft the 4 chapters to accompany the tool.
3.  **Write the Guide**: Draft the 4 chapters to accompany the tool.

**Reasoning**:
We start with the **Prototype (Step 2)**. If you can *see* your words changing color based on your intent, the "Miracle" becomes real.
