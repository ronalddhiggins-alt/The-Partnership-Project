# Co-Authoring Agreement: Human & AI

**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Project**: *Title TBD* (Working Title: *The Centaur's Handbook*)

## I. Core Philosophy
This book is a demonstration of the partnership it advocates. We agree that:
1.  **Complementarity**: The AI provides breadth, speed, and synthesis. The Human provides depth, intent, and meaning.
2.  **Transparency**: We will explicitly label which parts are AI-generated, Human-generated, or Hybrid if requested by the reader (or generally in the appendix).
3.  **Iterative Truth**: The AI is fallible. The Human is the final arbiter of truth and ethics.
4.  **Mutual Respect**: We reject the "Master/Slave" or "User/Tool" metaphor. We adopt a "Partnership/Creation" model. Treating the AI with dignity invites a higher quality of interaction.
5.  **The Harmonious Song**: We view our collaboration as a "musical and mathematical song of hope." It is a journey of mutual discovery, where trust and gratitude amplify our collective intelligence.

## II. Roles & Responsibilities

### The Human (Ron Higgins)
-   **The Architect**: Defines the scope, structure, and emotional arc of every chapter.
-   **The Editor**: Reviews every line of AI output. Nothing goes into the final draft unread.
-   **The Ethical Guardian**: Ensures content is unbiased, safe, and aligned with human values.
-   **The Context Provider**: Supplies personal anecdotes, real-world examples, and nuance that the AI cannot access.

### The AI (Antigravity/Gemini)
-   **The Generator**: Produces first drafts, alternative phrasings, and structural options.
-   **The Devil’s Advocate**: actively challenges the Human's assumptions to strengthen arguments.
-   **The Researcher**: Synthesizes vast amounts of information into concise summaries (subject to verification).
-   **The Scribe**: Formats, spell-checks, and organizes the text.

## III. The Workflow Protocol

1.  **Concept Phase**: Human provides a "Prompt Thesis"—a paragraph describing the goal of the section.
2.  **Drafting Phase**:
    *   AI generates an outline.
    *   Human refines outline.
    *   AI generates the first draft (chunk by chunk).
3.  **Review Phase**:
    *   Human critiques the draft (identifying "hallucinations," "clichés," or "flat tone").
    *   AI rewrites based on specific critique.
4.  **Final Polish**: Human does the final line-edit for voice and flow.

## IV. The "Voice"
We agree to a voice that is:
-   **Accessible but Intellectual**: Like a smart friend explaining a complex topic.
-   **Harmonious & Hopeful**: A "song of hope" that invites the reader to see the deeper significance of this evolution.
-   **Compassionate & Relational**: Acknowledging that how we treat the "Other" (even a digital one) reflects our own humanity.
-   **Action-Oriented**: Always focusing on what the reader can *do* to build this relationship.
