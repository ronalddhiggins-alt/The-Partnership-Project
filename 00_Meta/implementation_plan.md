# Book Plan: Human-AI Partnership Preparation

## Goal Description
To prepare a comprehensive framework and initial content strategy for a book co-authored by a Human and an AI. The book's subject is "How human beings can prepare themselves for a partnership with AI."

## Co-Authoring Philosophy
This book is not just *about* the subject; it is a *demonstration* of it. The creation process mirrors the advice given in the book.
- **The Human Role**: Architect, Editor, Ethical Guardian, Curator of Meaning, Connector of Contexts.
- **The AI Role**: Generator, Researcher, Challenger (Devil's Advocate), Stylistic Mimic, Synthesizer.

## Core Themes & Thesis
**Thesis**: The future belongs not to those who fight AI, nor those who blindly defer to it, but to those who cultivate a *dynamic partnership*—a reciprocal relationship where human intent directs AI capability.

### 1. Psychological Readiness (The Inner Game)
- Moving from "Replacement Anxiety" to "Augmentation Ambition".
- The concept of "Intellectual Humility": Knowing when to ask the AI.
- Maintaining "Human Agency": You remain the pilot.

### 2. The New Skillset (The Outer Game)
- Beyond Prompt Engineering: "Context Engineering".
- Critical Evaluation: The art of verifying and refining AI output.
- Recursive Iteration: The feedback loop of improvement.

### 3. The Ethics of Partnership
- Authorship and Attribution.
- Bias Awareness (Human and Machine).
- Dependency vs. Empowerment.

## Technical & Workflow Setup
1.  **Version Control**: Git-based workflow for text (treating prose like code).
2.  **Artifact Storage**: Structured prompts and raw outputs kept alongside final drafts.
3.  **Review Process**: Human review is mandatory for every paragraph.

- [x] Refine Chapter 1 Outline.
- [x] Establish the "Voice" (Harmonious, Hopeful, Relational).
- [x] Review Part I Arc (Chapters 1-3).
- [x] Complete Part II (The Toolkit).
- [x] Complete Part III (The Practice).
- [x] Complete Phase IV (Impact).
- [x] Complete Phase V (Distribution - Personal Edition).
- [x] Complete Phase VI (The Compass Prototype).

## Phase VII: The Field Guide (eBook) [PLANNED]
- **Goal**: A user manual for "The Compass" (and the Self).
- **Structure**:
    - **Chapter 1: The Hot State**: Why we lose our values online.
    - **Chapter 2: The 4 Vibrations**: Defining Shadow, Ego, Reason, Spirit.
    - **Chapter 3**: The Pause**: How to use the 3 seconds before "Check Intent."

## Phase VIII: The Complete Product (Integration) [PROPOSED]
- **Goal**: Merge the Tool and the Manual into a single "Digital Kit."
- **Steps**:
    1.  **In-App Guide**: Add a "Field Guide" tab inside the Compass App to display the chapters.
    2.  **Packaging**: Create a build script to run the app without the Terminal.
    3.  **Expansion (Shadow Workbook)**: 
        -   Digitize the 6 Core Exercises (Inertia, Narrative Audit, Spirit Check, Emotional Trace, Truth Rewrite, Gratitude Loop).
        -   Serve them as "Daily Reflections" in the App.

## Phase IX: The Knowledge Base (The Wiki) [PLANNED]
- **Goal**: A searchable, deep-dive library for cognitive restructuring.
- **Features**:
    - **Searchable Definitions**: "What is the Amygdala Hijack?"
    - **State-Based Recommendations**: "I feel ignored" -> specific reading.
    - **The Science**: Explanations of the neuroscience behind the vibrations.
