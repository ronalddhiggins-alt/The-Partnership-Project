        tags: ["science", "brain", "hot state"],
        definition: "A biological state where the primitive brain (Fight/Flight) temporarily overrides the Prefrontal Cortex (Logic/Empathy).",
        explanation: "During a hijack, your body is flooded with adrenaline. Your vision narrows, and you lose the ability to think about long-term consequences. You are purely reactive. The Compass provides the 'Pause' necessary for this chemical flood to subside.",
        action: "Do not type. Breathe for 3 seconds."

        tags: ["vibration", "danger", "fear"],
        definition: "The lowest frequency of communication, rooted in survival and fear.",
        explanation: "The Shadow is not 'Evil'; it is 'Scared'. It feels cornered. Its only goal is safety, often achieved by attacking others before they can attack you.",
        action: "Stop. You are in a defensive crouch. You cannot fix a relationship from here."

        id: "ego",
        term: "Ego Vibration (Orange)",
        tags: ["vibration", "status", "pride"],
        definition: "A frequency driven by the need for Status, Righteousness, and 'Winning'.",
        explanation: "The Ego wants to be Right more than it wants to be Connected. It uses sarcasm, condescension, and 'correction' to assert dominance.",
        action: "Ask yourself: 'Do I want to be Right, or do I want to be Connected?'"
    },
    {
        id: "reason",
        term: "Reason Vibration (Blue)",
        tags: ["vibration", "logic", "neutral"],
        definition: "A neutral frequency focused on Accuracy, Facts, and Logic.",
        explanation: "Reason is 'Safe Ground'. It removes the emotion and sticks to the data. It stops the bleeding, but it does not heal the wound.",
        action: "Use Reason to stabilize the conversation, then try to move up to Spirit."
    },
    {
        id: "spirit",
        term: "Spirit Vibration (Green)",
        tags: ["vibration", "connection", "love"],
        definition: "The highest frequency, focused on Unity, Grace, and Resolution.",
        explanation: "Spirit is not 'Soft'; it is 'Authoritative'. It speaks the truth without a weapon. It invites the other person to drop their guard.",
        action: "This is the destination. Stay here."

        id: "cooling_the_iron",
        term: "Cooling The Iron",
        tags: ["metaphor", "technique"],
        definition: "The act of letting your emotional temperature drop before handling a relationship.",
        explanation: "To forge a sword, you heat iron. To forge a connection, you must cool it. Handling a relationship while 'Hot' will burn both you and the other person.",
        action: "Paste your text into the Compass and wait."

        id: "elevator_rule",
        term: "The Elevator Rule",
        tags: ["technique", "strategy"],
        definition: "The principle that you cannot jump from Shadow (Red) to Spirit (Green) instantly.",
        explanation: "It is too far a leap. You must take the elevator floor by floor: Stop the Red -> Stand on Blue (Facts) -> Rise to Green (Connection).",
        action: "Identify your current floor and aim for the next one up."
    },

        id: "incubation",

        tags: ["shadow workbook", "silence"],
        definition: "The difference between mindful silence (gathering strength) and fearful silence (avoiding the radar).",
        explanation: "Incubation is a strategic pause. Hiding is a fear response. One leads to a stronger return; the other leads to atrophy.",
        action: "Ask: 'Am I gathering strength, or am I hiding?'"

        term: "The Intensity Scale",
        tags: ["dynamics", "volume"],
        definition: "The 'Volume' of a vibration. Low Shadow is Caution; High Shadow is Terror.",
        explanation: "Understanding intensity prevents over-reaction. A 10% Shadow score is just a warning light; a 90% score is a fire alarm.",
        action: "Check the percentage. Is it a whisper or a scream?"

        tags: ["dynamics", "trap"],
        definition: "A defensive loop where Ego protects a wounded Shadow.",
        explanation: "When we feel hurt (Shadow), we often pretend to be superior (Ego) to hide the pain. This creates arrogance masking insecurity.",
        action: "Drop the shield. Admit the hurt."

        explanation: "High Reason without Spirit is 'Cold Truth.' High Spirit without Reason is 'Vague Hope.' You need both to build a resolution.",
        action: "Use Logic to build the frame, use Spirit to fill the home."
