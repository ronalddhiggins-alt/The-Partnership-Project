## 📚 What is this?
This repository is a "Living Artifact." It contains the combined work of **Ron Higgins** (Human) and **Antigravity** (AI).
It is not just a book, and it is not just software. It is a kit.

### 1. The Core Text: *The Partnership*
*   **Location**: `The_Partnership_Complete_Edition.md`
*   **Description**: A comprehensive guide on how humans can prepare themselves for a partnership with AI. It covers the mindset shift from "Replacement Anxiety" to "Augmentation Ambition."

### 2. The Memoir: *The Return of the Dream*
*   **Location**: `The_Return_of_the_Dream_Complete.md`
*   **Description**: A personal case study by Ron Higgins (78). It details his journey of overcoming 72 years of Aphantasia (mind-blindness) and turning the "Shadow" into "Spirit" using the very tools described in this repo.

### 3. The Tool: *The Compass* (Developer Preview)
*   **Location**: `/3_SOFTWARE_STUDIO/compass_app`
*   **Description**: A software application designed to map human "Vibrations" (Shadow, Ego, Reason, Spirit).
*   **Technical Note**: This is a **Prototype**. It runs locally on Mac, Windows, and Linux, but it requires technical knowledge to install (Node.js required). It is NOT a finished consumer product. It is open for developers to explore, fork, and improve.
*   **How to Run**: See `3_SOFTWARE_STUDIO/compass_app/README.md`.
